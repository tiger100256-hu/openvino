| [Documentation for Pre-Trained Models ](@ref omz_models_group_intel)                                   | Documentation for the pre-trained models available in the [Open Model Zoo repo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo).  |
| Deep Learning Streamer (DL Streamer)   | Streaming analytics framework, based on GStreamer\*, for constructing graphs of media analytics components. For the DL Streamer documentation, see [DL Streamer Samples](@ref gst_samples_README), [API Reference](https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/dlstreamer_gst/), [Elements](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/dlstreamer_gst/wiki/Elements), [Tutorial](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/dlstreamer_gst/wiki/DL-Streamer-Tutorial). |


## Install Packages

### Set up the OpenVINO™ Toolkit APT Repository

#### Install the GPG key for the Repository

1. Download the public key from [https://apt.repos.intel.com/openvino/2021/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-OPENVINO-2021](https://apt.repos.intel.com/openvino/2021/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-OPENVINO-2021) and save it to a file. 
2. Add this key to the system keyring:
```sh
sudo apt-key add <PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_GPG_KEY>
```
> **NOTE**: You might need to install GnuPG: `sudo apt-get install gnupg`

3. Check the list of APT keys running the following command:
```sh
sudo apt-key list
```

#### Add the Repository

Run the following command:
```sh
echo "deb https://apt.repos.intel.com/openvino/2021 all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-openvino-2021.list
```

#### Update the List of Packages

Run the `update` command:
```sh
sudo apt update
```

#### Verify that the APT Repository is Properly Set Up

Run the `apt-cache` command to see a list of all available OpenVINO packages and components:
```sh
apt-cache search openvino
```
See the example commands below:

* **Runtime Packages**
  
  On Ubuntu 18.04:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-cache search intel-openvino-runtime-ubuntu18
  ```
  On Ubuntu 20.04:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-cache search intel-openvino-runtime-ubuntu20
  ```
* **Developer Packages**

  On Ubuntu 18.04:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-cache search intel-openvino-dev-ubuntu18
  ```
  On Ubuntu 20.04:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-cache search intel-openvino-dev-ubuntu20
  ```

### Install Runtime or Developer Packages using the APT Package Manager
Intel® OpenVINO™ Toolkit will be installed in: `/opt/intel/openvino_<VERSION>.<UPDATE>.<BUILD_NUM>`

A symlink will be created: `/opt/intel/openvino_<VERSION>`

#### To Install a Specific Version

1. Get a list of OpenVINO packages available for installation:
```sh
sudo apt-cache search intel-openvino-runtime-ubuntu18
```
2. Install a specific version of an OpenVINO package:
```sh
sudo apt install intel-openvino-<PACKAGE_TYPE>-ubuntu<OS_VERSION>-<VERSION>.<UPDATE>.<BUILD_NUM>
```
See the example commands below:
* **Runtime Package**<br>
  On Ubuntu 18.04:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install intel-openvino-runtime-ubuntu18-2021.1.105
  ```
  On Ubuntu 20.04:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install intel-openvino-runtime-ubuntu20-2021.1.105
  ```
* **Developer Package**<br>
  On Ubuntu 18.04:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install intel-openvino-dev-ubuntu18-2021.1.105 
  ```
  On Ubuntu 20.04:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install intel-openvino-dev-ubuntu20-2021.1.105
  ```

#### To check for Installed Packages and Versions

To get a list of installed OpenVINO packages:

```sh
apt list --installed | grep openvino
```

#### To Uninstall a Specific Version

To uninstall a specific package:
```sh
sudo apt autoremove intel-openvino-<PACKAGE_TYPE>-ubuntu<OS_VERSION>-<VERSION>.<UPDATE>.<BUILD_NUM>
```
