This collection of Python tutorials are written for running on [Jupyter*](https://jupyter.org) notebooks. The tutorials provide an introduction to the OpenVINO™ toolkit and explain how to use the Python API and tools for optimized deep learning inference. You can run the code one section at a time to see how to integrate your application with OpenVINO™ libraries.
